# Take-Home Assignment: Dropbox-Like Directory Management System

## Overview
In this assignment, you'll build a Dropbox-like system where users can manage a hierarchical structure of directories and subdirectories. This system should allow the creation, renaming, deletion, and listing of directories with infinite nesting (subdirectories). You are expected to implement both a frontend and backend for this feature.

Your solution should demonstrate good coding practices, system design, and a focus on performance and scalability.

## Requirements

### 1. API
Build a RESTful API that supports the following directory management operations:

- **Create a Directory**:
  - The directory should be created under the given parent directory.

- **Rename a Directory**:
  - Renames the directory with the specified ID.

- **Delete a Directory**:
  - Deleting a directory should also remove all its subdirectories recursively.

- **List Directories**:
  - This should return the directory structure starting from the given directory ID, including all its subdirectories.


### 2. Frontend
- Build a simple interface that allows users to:
  - **View the directory structure**: Display directories and subdirectories in a tree format.
  - **Create a new directory**: A form that allows users to input a directory name and optionally select a parent directory.
  - **Rename a directory**: Enable users to rename directories via an inline edit or form.
  - **Delete a directory**: Provide the ability to delete a directory, with a confirmation step.

- The frontend should reflect updates in real-time when a user creates, renames, or deletes a directory.
- It should be user-friendly, with minimal but effective design.

### 3. Additional Requirements
- **Code quality**: Solution should be production ready quality.
- **Deployment**: Please document how we can deploy this solution locally and in production environment.

### 4. Bonus Features (Optional)
- Provide a search feature to quickly find a directory by name.
- If you think your solution does not scale to 1 million users (which is fine), please document how you would address scalability concerns.
-   Provide documentation on how to implement authentication and authorization
## Submission Guidelines
1. **Code**: Provide a link to a GitHub repository or a zip file containing your code. Include instructions on how to set up and run the project locally.
2. **Documentation**: Include a README with details about the solution, the design decisions you made, and how to run the project in production.
   
Good luck!
